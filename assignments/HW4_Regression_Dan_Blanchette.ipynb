We also observe that the R^2 indicates that it is increasing in goodness of fit with the calculated regression line. This is governed by a couple of attributes concerning our model, the max depth and the min_samples_leaf parameters set for this experiment.\n",

        "\n",
        "When the depth of a tree is not set or goes to a large max depth value without a minimum leaf value, the tree can become unbalanced and skew the data which often results in the results from the model being overfit. If a minimum leaf value is set too low(num_leaves < 50) and the depth is set to a larger number value, this can also result in overfitting. \n",
