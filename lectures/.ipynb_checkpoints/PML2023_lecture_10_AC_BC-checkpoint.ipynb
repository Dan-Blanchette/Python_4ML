    "We have discussed a simple validation method to evaluate the performance of a machine learning (ML) model.\n",
    "- Randomly split a data set into two parts: one is used as the *training set* to train a machine learning model. The other set-the *test set*- is used to calculate the test error (**generalization error**)\n",
    "- The ultimate goal is to train a ML model that has the minumum generalization error.\n",
    "- A common methodological mistake is \"testing on the training set\": involve test data samples in the training set.\n",
